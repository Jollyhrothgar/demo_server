# Demo Framework

This repo contains the webserver for showing demos. Additional setup is required
to configure the hooks for the git server. 

# Installing

Slight modification to: run.command and mlpux.command may be needed for running
on a different machine or OS. As this project is in active development, only the
development machine is currently supported (Mike's Laptop).

Assuming that you want to try running yourself, the whole shebang can be kicked 
off with:

<pre>
<code>
./run_all.sh
</code>
</pre>
